# 🏢 `organizations` – Add organizations with members and invitations to your Rails SaaS

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/organizations.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/organizations) [![Build Status](https://github.com/rameerez/organizations/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rameerez/organizations/actions)

> [!TIP]
> **🚀 Ship your next Rails app 10x faster!** I've built **[RailsFast](https://railsfast.com/?ref=organizations)**, a production-ready Rails boilerplate template that comes with everything you need to launch a software business in days, not weeks. Go [check it out](https://railsfast.com/?ref=organizations)!

`organizations` adds organizations with members to any Rails app. It handles team invites, user memberships, roles, and permissions.

**🎮 [Try the live demo →](https://organizations.rameerez.com)**

[TODO: invitation / member management gif]

It's everything you need to turn a `User`-based app into a multi-tenant, `Organization`-based B2B SaaS (users belong in organizations, and organizations share resources and billing, etc.)

It's super easy:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_organizations
end
```

That's it. Your users can now create organizations, invite teammates, and jump between accounts:

```ruby
current_user.create_organization!("Acme Corp")
current_user.send_organization_invite_to!("teammate@acme.com")
```

Then you could switch to the new org like this:

```ruby
switch_to_organization!(@org)
```

And check your roles / permissions in relation to that organization like this:

```ruby
current_user.is_organization_owner?     # => true
current_user.is_organization_admin?     # => true (owners inherit admin permissions)
```

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "organizations"
```

> [!NOTE]
> For beautiful invitation emails, optionally add [`goodmail`](https://github.com/rameerez/goodmail).

Then:

```bash
bundle install
rails g organizations:install
rails db:migrate
```

Add `has_organizations` to your User model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_organizations
end
```

That's the simplest setup. You can also configure per-model options:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_organizations do
    max_organizations 5         # Limit how many orgs a user can own (nil = unlimited)
    create_personal_org true    # Auto-create org on signup (default: false)
    require_organization true   # Require users to have at least one org (default: false)
  end
end
```

> **Note:** By default, users can exist without any organization (invite-to-join flow). Set `create_personal_org true` if you want to auto-create a personal organization when users sign up.

Mount the engine in your routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
mount Organizations::Engine => '/'
```

Done. Your app now has full organizations / teams support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bring Your Own UI (BYOU):** This gem provides all the building blocks — models, controllers, routes, helpers, and mailers — but intentionally **does not ship with views**. Views are too context-dependent (Tailwind vs Bootstrap, dark mode, your app's design system) to be one-size-fits-all. You'll need to create your own views in `app/views/organizations/`. For a complete working example, check out the demo app in [`test/dummy`](test/dummy/app/views/organizations/).

> [!NOTE]
> This gem uses the term "organization", but the concept is the same as "team", "workspace", or "account". It's essentially just an umbrella under which users / members are organized. This gem works for all those use cases, in the same way. Just use whichever term fits your product best in your UI.

## Quick start

### Create an organization

```ruby
org = current_user.create_organization!("Acme Corp")
# User automatically becomes the owner
```

### Invite teammates

```ruby
current_user.send_organization_invite_to!("teammate@example.com")
# Sends invitation email: "John invited you to join Acme Corp"
# When accepted, user joins as :member (default role)
```

The invitation goes from user to user. The organization is inferred from `current_organization`. You can also be explicit:

```ruby
current_user.send_organization_invite_to!("teammate@example.com", organization: other_org)
```

### Check roles and permissions

```ruby
# Quick role checks (in current organization)
current_user.is_organization_owner?   # => true/false
current_user.is_organization_admin?   # => true/false

# Permission checks
current_user.has_organization_permission_to?(:invite_members)
# "Does current user have organization permission to invite members?"

# Check role in a specific org
current_user.is_admin_of?(@org)
# "Is current user an admin of this org?"

current_user.is_member_of?(@org)
# "Is current user a member of this org?"
```

### Switch between organizations

```ruby
# User belongs to multiple organizations? No problem.
current_user.organizations        # => [acme, startup_co, personal]
switch_to_organization!(startup_co)  # Changes active org in session
```

### Protect controllers

```ruby
class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_organization!
  before_action :require_organization_admin!, only: [:create, :destroy]
end
```

## Limit seats per plan (with `pricing_plans`)

> **Note:** This is an integration pattern, not built-in functionality. You implement the limit checks in your callbacks.

If you're using [`pricing_plans`](https://github.com/rameerez/pricing_plans), you can limit how many members an organization can have based on their subscription using callbacks:

```ruby
# config/initializers/pricing_plans.rb
plan :hobby do
  limits :organization_members, to: 3
end

plan :growth do
  limits :organization_members, to: 25
end
```

Then hook into the `on_member_invited` callback to enforce limits. **This callback runs BEFORE the invitation is persisted**, so raising an error will block the invitation:

```ruby
# config/initializers/organizations.rb
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.on_member_invited do |ctx|
    org = ctx.organization
    limit = org.current_plan.limit_for(:organization_members)

    if limit && org.member_count >= limit
      raise Organizations::InvitationError, "Member limit reached. Please upgrade your plan."
    end
  end
end
```

The `on_member_invited` callback is special — it runs in **strict mode**, meaning:
- It executes **before** the invitation is saved to the database
- Raising any error will **veto** the invitation (it won't be created)
- The error message is returned to the user

This pattern gives you full control over how and when limits are enforced.

## Why this gem exists

Organizations / teams are tough to do alone. Wiring up accounts, roles, and invites by hand is a pain you only want to go through once. If you don't implement organizations / teams on day one, adding them later becomes a major refactor — the kind that touches every model, controller, and permission in your app. Even experienced Rails developers have built accounts / teams poorly multiple times before getting it right.

No more asking yourself "should I just roll my own?" No more stitching together `acts_as_tenant` + `rolify` + `devise_invitable` + `pundit` and writing 500 lines of glue code. No more paying $250/year for a boilerplate template just because it has organizations / teams built in. The `organizations` gem gives you everything in a single `bundle add`.

Every B2B Rails app eventually needs organizations / teams. Yet there's no standalone gem that allows you to just flip a switch and add organizations to your app.

| What you need | What exists today |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Organization model | ✅ Easy, just scaffold it |
| Membership (User ↔ Organization join table) | ❌ Write it yourself |
| Invite users to a *specific* organization | ❌ `devise_invitable` invites to the *app*, not to an org |
| Roles scoped to each organization | ❌ `rolify` stores roles globally, not per-org |
| Let users jump between organizations | ❌ Write it yourself |
| **All of the above, integrated** | ❌ **Pay $250+ for a boilerplate** |

The day will come when you need to associate your users in organizations — and it will be the refactor from your worst nightmares. Rails does not make your life easy when you want to work this way, with multiple tenants. The typical Rails developer stitches together `acts_as_tenant` + `rolify` + `devise_invitable` + `pundit` and writes 500-1,000 lines of glue code that feels brittle compared to the usual simplicity of Rails. That takes 1-2 months. Some developers have estimated 200+ hours of work. Or you pay $250+/year for a boilerplate template where organizations / teams is the headline feature.

Laravel has Jetstream with a `--teams` flag. Django has `django-organizations`. Rails has had nothing — until now.

| Framework | Organizations / Teams Solution | Cost |
|-----------|-------------------------------|------|
| Laravel | Jetstream `--teams` | Free |
| Django | django-organizations | Free |
| Rails | `organizations` gem | Free |

`organizations` gives you the complete `User → Membership → Organization` pattern with scoped invitations, hierarchical roles, and the ability to switch between organizations – all in a single, well-tested gem that works with your existing Devise setup. What previously took 1.5 months now takes 3 days.

> ![NOTE]
> This gem handles organization membership and org-level permissions (who can invite members, who can manage billing). For per-record authorization ("can user X edit document Y"), use [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) or [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) alongside this gem.

invitation.accept!(user)        # Accept with explicit user
invitation.resend!              # Send invitation email again
```

## Controller helpers

Include the controller concern in your ApplicationController:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Organizations::Controller
end
```

This gives you:

```ruby
# Context helpers
current_organization            # Active organization (from session)
current_membership              # Current user's membership in active org
organization_signed_in?         # Is there an active organization?

# Pending invitation helpers
pending_organization_invitation_token   # Get pending invitation token from session
pending_organization_invitation         # Get pending invitation (clears if expired)
pending_organization_invitation?        # Check if valid pending invitation exists
clear_pending_organization_invitation!  # Clear invitation token and cache

# Invitation acceptance (canonical helper for post-signup flows)
accept_pending_organization_invitation!(user)                    # Accept with session token
accept_pending_organization_invitation!(user, token: token)      # Explicit token
accept_pending_organization_invitation!(user, switch: false)     # Don't auto-switch org
# Returns InvitationAcceptanceResult or nil

# Invitation redirect helpers
redirect_path_when_invitation_requires_authentication(invitation)  # Get auth redirect
redirect_path_after_invitation_accepted(invitation, user: user)    # Get post-accept redirect

# Authorization
require_organization!                               # Redirect if no active org
require_organization_role!(:admin)                  # Require at least admin role
require_organization_permission_to!(:invite_members) # Require specific permission

# Authorization shortcuts (for common roles)
require_organization_owner!     # Same as require_organization_role!(:owner)
require_organization_admin!     # Same as require_organization_role!(:admin)

# Switching
switch_to_organization!(org)              # Change active org in session
switch_to_organization!(org, user: user)  # Explicit user (for auth-transition flows)
```

### Protecting resources

```ruby
class SettingsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_organization!
  before_action :require_organization_admin!  # Shortcut for require_organization_role!(:admin)

  def billing
    require_organization_owner!  # Only owners can manage billing
  end
end
```

### Handling unauthorized access

Configure how unauthorized access is handled:

```ruby
# config/initializers/organizations.rb
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.on_unauthorized do |context|
    # context.user, context.organization, context.permission, context.required_role
    redirect_to root_path, alert: "You don't have permission to do that."
  end

  config.on_no_organization do |context|
    redirect_to new_organization_path, alert: "Please create or join an organization first."
  end
end
```

## View helpers

Include in your ApplicationHelper:

```ruby
module ApplicationHelper
  include Organizations::ViewHelpers
end
```

### Permission checks in views

```ruby
<% if current_user.has_organization_permission_to?(:invite_members) %>
  <%= link_to "Invite teammate", new_invitation_path %>
<% end %>

<% if current_user.is_organization_admin? %>
  <%= link_to "Settings", organization_settings_path %>
<% end %>
```

### Organization switcher

Build your own switcher UI with the helper:

```ruby
<% data = organization_switcher_data %>

<div class="org-switcher">
  <button><%= data[:current][:name] %></button>
  <ul>
    <% data[:others].each do |org| %>
      <li>
        <%= link_to org[:name], data[:switch_path].call(org[:id]) %>
      </li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
</div>
```

The helper returns:

```ruby
{
  current: { id: "...", name: "Acme Corp" },
  others: [
    { id: "...", name: "Personal" },
    { id: "...", name: "StartupCo" }
  ],
  switch_path: ->(org_id) { "/organizations/switch/#{org_id}" }
}
```

### Invitation badge

```ruby
# Show pending invitation count in your navbar
<%= organization_invitation_badge(current_user) %>
# => <span class="badge">3</span> (if 3 pending invitations)
# => nil (if no pending invitations)
```

## Roles and permissions

### Organization permissions vs. resource authorization

`organizations` handles **org-level permissions** — what a user can do *within an organization*:

```ruby
current_user.has_organization_permission_to?(:invite_members)
# "Can they invite people to this org?"

current_user.has_organization_permission_to?(:manage_billing)
# "Can they manage this org's billing?"

require_organization_permission_to!(:manage_settings)
# Gate org settings pages
```

This is different from **resource authorization** (Pundit, CanCanCan) — what a user can do *to a specific record*:

```ruby
# Pundit/CanCanCan territory (not what this gem does)
policy(@document).update?      # "Can they edit THIS specific document?"
authorize! :destroy, @project  # "Can they delete THIS specific project?"
```

| | `organizations` gem | Pundit / CanCanCan |
|---|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Question** | "What can this user do in this org?" | "Can this user do X to record Y?" |
| **Scope** | Organization-wide capabilities | Per-record authorization |
| **Based on** | Role in Membership | Policy classes / Ability rules |
| **Example** | "Admins can invite members" | "Users can edit their own posts" |

**Most B2B apps need both.** Use `organizations` for org membership and capabilities. Use Pundit/CanCanCan for fine-grained resource authorization. They're complementary, not competing.

### Built-in roles

`organizations` ships with four hierarchical roles:

```
owner > admin > member > viewer
```

Each role inherits all permissions from roles below it.

### Default permissions

| Permission | viewer | member | admin | owner |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| `view_organization` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `view_members` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `create_resources` | | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `edit_own_resources` | | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `delete_own_resources` | | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `invite_members` | | | ✅ | ✅ |
| `remove_members` | | | ✅ | ✅ |
| `edit_member_roles` | | | ✅ | ✅ |
| `manage_settings` | | | ✅ | ✅ |
| `view_billing` | | | ✅ | ✅ |
| `manage_billing` | | | | ✅ |
| `transfer_ownership` | | | | ✅ |
| `delete_organization` | | | | ✅ |

### Customize roles and permissions

Define your own roles in the initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/organizations.rb
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.roles do
    role :viewer do
      can :view_organization
      can :view_members
    end

    role :member, inherits: :viewer do
      can :create_resources
      can :edit_own_resources
      can :delete_own_resources
    end

    role :admin, inherits: :member do
      can :invite_members
      can :remove_members
      can :edit_member_roles
      can :manage_settings
    end

    role :owner, inherits: :admin do
      can :manage_billing
      can :transfer_ownership
      can :delete_organization
    end
  end
end
```

### Add custom permissions

```ruby
role :admin, inherits: :member do
  can :invite_members
  can :remove_members
  can :manage_api_keys      # Your custom permission
  can :export_data          # Your custom permission
end
```

Then check them anywhere:

```ruby
current_user.has_organization_permission_to?(:manage_api_keys)
require_organization_permission_to!(:export_data)
```

## Invitations

### Sending invitations

Invitations are user-to-user. The inviter is always explicit, and the email reads *"John invited you to join Acme Corp"*.

```ruby
# Invite to your current organization (most common)
current_user.send_organization_invite_to!("teammate@example.com")

# Invite to a specific organization
current_user.send_organization_invite_to!("teammate@example.com", organization: other_org)

# All invitees join as :member by default. Admins can promote after joining.
```

There's also an organization-centric API if you prefer:

```ruby
org.send_invite_to!("teammate@example.com", invited_by: current_user)
```

> **Note:** Both APIs enforce authorization. The inviter must be a member of the organization with the `:invite_members` permission. If not, `Organizations::NotAMember` or `Organizations::NotAuthorized` is raised.

### Invitation flow

The gem handles **both existing users and new signups** with a single invitation link:

**For existing users:**
1. Invitation created → Email sent with unique link
2. User clicks link → Sees invitation details (org name, inviter, role)
3. User clicks "Accept" → Membership created, redirected to org

**For new users:**
1. Invitation created → Email sent with unique link
2. User clicks link → Sees invitation details + "Sign up to accept" button
3. User registers → Token stored in session, your app calls `invitation.accept!(user)` post-signup

The gem stores the invitation token in `session[:organizations_pending_invitation_token]` when an unauthenticated user tries to accept. Use the built-in helper to accept the invitation in your auth callbacks:

```ruby
# In your ApplicationController (works with Devise or any auth system)
def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
  if (result = accept_pending_organization_invitation!(resource))
    return redirect_path_after_invitation_accepted(result.invitation, user: resource)
  end
  super
end

def after_sign_up_path_for(resource)
  if (result = accept_pending_organization_invitation!(resource))
    return redirect_path_after_invitation_accepted(result.invitation, user: resource)
  end
  super
end
```

The `accept_pending_organization_invitation!` helper handles:
- Token lookup from session
- Invitation validation (expired, already accepted, email match)
- Membership creation
- Organization context switching
- Session cleanup

It returns an `InvitationAcceptanceResult` object or `nil`:

```ruby
result = accept_pending_organization_invitation!(user)
result.accepted?      # => true if freshly accepted
result.already_member? # => true if user was already a member
result.switched?      # => true if org context was switched
result.invitation     # => the invitation record
result.membership     # => the membership record
```

Configure redirects in your initializer:

```ruby
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.redirect_path_when_invitation_requires_authentication = "/users/sign_up"
  config.redirect_path_after_invitation_accepted = "/dashboard"

  # Or use procs for dynamic paths:
  config.redirect_path_after_invitation_accepted = ->(inv, user) {
    "/org/#{inv.organization_id}/welcome"
  }
end
```

> **Note:** When accepting invitations in custom auth flows (Devise overrides, `bypass_sign_in`, etc.), the gem handles stale memoization issues automatically by passing the explicit user to `switch_to_organization!`.

### Invitation emails

The gem ships with a clean ActionMailer-based invitation email.

```ruby
# Customize the mailer in config
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.invitation_mailer = "Organizations::InvitationMailer"  # Default
  # Or use your own: config.invitation_mailer = "CustomInvitationMailer"
end
```

### Invitation expiration

Invitations expire after 7 days by default:

```ruby
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.invitation_expiry = 7.days  # Default
  # config.invitation_expiry = 30.days
  # config.invitation_expiry = nil  # Never expire
end
```

Expired invitations can be resent:

```ruby
invitation.expired?   # => true
invitation.resend!    # Generates new token, resets expiry, sends email
```

### Accepted invitations

Accepted invitations are kept for audit purposes:

```ruby
org.invitations.accepted  # Who was invited and when
invitation.accepted_at    # When they joined
invitation.invited_by     # Who sent the invitation
```

## Organization switching

Users can belong to multiple organizations. The "current" organization is stored in session, and all your queries scope to it automatically.

### How it works

1. User logs in → `current_organization` set to their most recently used org
2. User switches org → Session updated, `current_organization` changes
3. User is removed from current org → Auto-switches to next available org

### Manual switching

```ruby
# In a controller
def switch
  org = current_user.organizations.find(params[:id])
  switch_to_organization!(org)
  redirect_to dashboard_path
end
```

### Routes provided by the engine

When you mount the engine, you get:

```
POST /organizations/switch/:id  → Organizations::SwitchController#create
GET  /invitations/:token        → Organizations::PublicInvitationsController#show
POST /invitations/:token/accept → Organizations::PublicInvitationsController#accept
```

## Auto-created organizations

By default, users do **not** get an auto-created organization on signup (invite-to-join flow). You can enable this if you want:

```ruby
# When always_create_personal_organization_for_each_user is enabled:
# 1. Organization created with name from config
# 2. User becomes owner of that organization
# 3. current_organization set to this new org
```

### Enable auto-creation

```ruby
Organizations.configure do |config|
  # Enable auto-creation (disabled by default)
  config.always_create_personal_organization_for_each_user = true

  # Customize the name
  config.default_organization_name = ->(user) { "#{user.email.split('@').first}'s Workspace" }
  # Default: "Personal"
end
```

By default (`always_create_personal_organization_for_each_user = false`), users must explicitly create or be invited to an organization.

### Users without organizations (default behavior)

By default, users can exist without any organization (invite-to-join flow):

1. User signs up → verifies email
2. User is in "limbo" (no organization yet)
3. User creates org OR accepts invitation
4. User now has an organization

This is the default behavior. If you want to auto-create a personal organization on signup, configure your User model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_organizations do
    create_personal_org true     # Auto-create org on signup
    require_organization true    # Require users to always have an org
  end
end
```

When a user has no organization:

```ruby
current_user.organization                    # => nil
current_user.current_organization            # => nil
current_user.belongs_to_any_organization?    # => false
current_user.is_organization_admin?          # => false (no org context)

# In controllers
current_organization                         # => nil
organization_signed_in?                      # => false
require_organization!                        # Redirects to on_no_organization handler
```

Handle the limbo state in your views:

```erb
<% if current_user.belongs_to_any_organization? %>
  <%= render "dashboard" %>
<% else %>
  <%= render "onboarding/create_or_join_organization" %>
<% end %>
```

Configure where to redirect users without an organization:

```ruby
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.on_no_organization do |context|
    redirect_to new_organization_path, notice: "Create or join an organization to continue."
  end
end
```

## Configuration

  # Custom mailer for invitations
  config.invitation_mailer = "Organizations::InvitationMailer"

  # === Limits ===
  # Maximum organizations a user can own (nil = unlimited)
  config.max_organizations_per_user = nil

  # === Onboarding ===
  # Require users to belong to at least one organization
  # Set to true if users should always have an organization
  config.always_require_users_to_belong_to_one_organization = false  # Default

  # === Redirects ===

  config.redirect_path_when_no_organization = "/organizations/new"

  # Where to redirect after organization is created (nil = default show page)
  # Can be a String or Proc: ->(org) { "/orgs/#{org.id}/setup" }
  config.after_organization_created_redirect_path = "/dashboard"

  # === Invitation Flow Redirects ===
  # Where to redirect unauthenticated users when they try to accept an invitation
  # Default: nil (uses new_user_registration_path or root_path)
  config.redirect_path_when_invitation_requires_authentication = "/users/sign_up"
  # Or use a Proc: ->(invitation, user) { "/signup?invite=#{invitation.token}" }

  # Where to redirect after an invitation is accepted
  # Default: nil (uses root_path)
  config.redirect_path_after_invitation_accepted = "/dashboard"
  # Or use a Proc: ->(invitation, user) { "/org/#{invitation.organization_id}/welcome" }

  # === Organizations Controller ===
  # Additional params to permit when creating/updating organizations
  # Use this to add custom fields like support_email, billing_email, logo
  config.additional_organization_params = [:support_email]

  # === Engine Controllers ===
  # Base controller for authenticated routes (default: ::ApplicationController)
  config.parent_controller = "::ApplicationController"

  # Base controller for public routes like invitation acceptance.
  # Works with Devise out of the box - no configuration needed.
  # Only override if using custom auth or needing specific inheritance.
  # Default: ActionController::Base
  # config.public_controller = "ActionController::Base"

  # === Handlers ===

  config.on_unauthorized do |context|
    redirect_to root_path, alert: "Not authorized"
  end

  # Called when no organization is set
  config.on_no_organization do |context|
    redirect_to config.redirect_path_when_no_organization
  end

  # === Roles & Permissions ===
  config.roles do
    # ... (see Roles and Permissions section)
  end

  # === Callbacks ===
  config.on_organization_created do |ctx|
    # ctx.organization, ctx.user (owner)
  end

  config.on_member_invited do |ctx|
    # ctx.organization, ctx.invitation, ctx.invited_by
  end

  config.on_member_joined do |ctx|
    # ctx.organization, ctx.membership, ctx.user
  end

  config.on_member_removed do |ctx|
    # ctx.organization, ctx.membership, ctx.user, ctx.removed_by
  end

  config.on_role_changed do |ctx|
    # ctx.organization, ctx.membership, ctx.old_role, ctx.new_role, ctx.changed_by
  end

  config.on_ownership_transferred do |ctx|
    # ctx.organization, ctx.old_owner, ctx.new_owner
  end
end
```

## Integrations

### Works with Devise out of the box

`organizations` is built for Devise. It uses `current_user` and `authenticate_user!` by default. Just add `has_organizations` and you're done.

### Works with other auth systems

Using Rodauth, Sorcery, or custom auth? Configure the methods:

```ruby
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.current_user_method = :current_account
  config.authenticate_user_method = :require_login
end
```

### Integrates with acts_as_tenant

For automatic query scoping, include the integration concern:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Organizations::Controller
  include Organizations::ActsAsTenantIntegration
  # Automatically calls: set_current_tenant(current_organization)
end
```

### Integrates with pricing_plans

Enforce member limits based on pricing plans using callbacks:

```ruby
# In your Organization model
class Organization < ApplicationRecord
  include PricingPlans::PlanOwner
end

# In config/initializers/pricing_plans.rb
plan :starter do
  limits :members, to: 5
end

plan :pro do
  limits :members, to: 50
end
```

Then hook into callbacks to enforce limits (see "Limit seats per plan" section above for full example).

### Integrates with your gem ecosystem

`organizations` is designed to work with rameerez's gem ecosystem:

```ruby
# Organization owns API keys (api_keys gem)
class Organization < ApplicationRecord
  has_api_keys do
    max_keys 10
  end
end

# Organization has credits (usage_credits gem)
class Organization < ApplicationRecord
  has_credits
end

# Organization has pricing plan (pricing_plans gem)
class Organization < ApplicationRecord
  include PricingPlans::PlanOwner
end
```

All scoped through `current_organization`:

```ruby
current_organization.api_keys
current_organization.credits
current_organization.current_pricing_plan
current_organization.memberships  # From organizations gem
```

## Callbacks

Hook into organization lifecycle events:

```ruby
Organizations.configure do |config|
  config.on_organization_created do |ctx|
    SlackNotifier.notify("New org: #{ctx.organization.name}")
    Analytics.track(ctx.user, "organization_created")
  end

  config.on_member_joined do |ctx|
    WelcomeMailer.send_team_welcome(ctx.user, ctx.organization).deliver_later
    Analytics.track(ctx.user, "joined_organization", org: ctx.organization.name)
  end

  config.on_member_removed do |ctx|
    AuditLog.record(
      action: :member_removed,
      organization: ctx.organization,
      user: ctx.user,
      actor: ctx.removed_by
    )
  end
end
```

### Available callbacks

| Callback | Context fields | Mode |
|----------|----------------|------|
| `on_organization_created` | `organization`, `user` | After |
| `on_member_invited` | `organization`, `invitation`, `invited_by` | **Before (strict)** |
| `on_member_joined` | `organization`, `membership`, `user` | After |
| `on_member_removed` | `organization`, `membership`, `user`, `removed_by` | After |
| `on_role_changed` | `organization`, `membership`, `old_role`, `new_role`, `changed_by` | After |
| `on_ownership_transferred` | `organization`, `old_owner`, `new_owner` | After |

**Callback modes:**
- **After**: Runs after the action completes. Errors are logged but don't block the operation. Use for notifications, analytics, and audit logs.
- **Before (strict)**: Runs before the action. Raising an error **vetoes** the operation. Use for validation and policy enforcement (e.g., seat limits).

## Testing

### Test helpers

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
require "organizations/test_helpers"

class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  include Organizations::TestHelpers
end
```

### Fixtures

The gem works with Rails fixtures:

```yaml
# test/fixtures/organizations.yml
acme:
  name: Acme Corp

# test/fixtures/memberships.yml
john_at_acme:
  user: john
  organization: acme
  role: admin
```

### Test helpers

```ruby
# Set organization context in tests
sign_in_as_organization_member(user, org, role: :admin)
set_current_organization(org)

# Or manually
sign_in user
switch_to_organization!(org)
```

### Minitest assertions

```ruby
assert user.is_member_of?(org)
assert user.is_owner_of?(org)
assert user.is_organization_admin?
assert user.has_organization_permission_to?(:invite_members)
assert user.belongs_to_any_organization?
```

## Extending the Organization model

The gem provides `Organizations::Organization` as the base model. You can extend it with your app's specific fields by adding migrations and reopening the class:

```ruby
# db/migrate/xxx_add_custom_fields_to_organizations.rb
class AddCustomFieldsToOrganizations < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    add_column :organizations_organizations, :support_email, :string
    add_column :organizations_organizations, :billing_address, :text
    add_column :organizations_organizations, :settings, :jsonb, default: {}
  end
end
```

```ruby
# config/initializers/organization_extensions.rb
# Or: app/models/concerns/organization_extensions.rb (then include in initializer)

Organizations::Organization.class_eval do
  # Add your own associations
  has_many :projects
  has_many :documents

  # Add your own validations
  validates :support_email, presence: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }

  # Add your own methods
  def active_projects
    projects.where(archived: false)
  end
end
```

Alternatively, create your own model that inherits from the gem's model:

```ruby
# app/models/organization.rb
class Organization < Organizations::Organization
  has_many :projects
  has_many :documents

  validates :support_email, presence: true
end
```

> **Note:** If you create your own `Organization` class, be aware that internal gem code uses `Organizations::Organization`. Your subclass will work for your app code, but associations from `User#organizations` will return `Organizations::Organization` instances.

This is standard Rails practice — the gem provides the foundation (memberships, invitations, roles), your app extends it with domain-specific features.

## Database schema

The gem creates three tables:

### organizations_organizations

```sql
organizations_organizations
  - id (primary key, auto-detects UUID or integer from your app)
  - name (string, required)
  - metadata (jsonb, default: {})
  - created_at
  - updated_at
```

> **Note:** The gem automatically detects your app's primary key type (UUID or integer) and uses it for all tables.

### organizations_memberships

```sql
organizations_memberships
  - id (primary key)
  - user_id (foreign key, indexed)
  - organization_id (foreign key, indexed)
  - role (string, default: 'member')
  - invited_by_id (foreign key, nullable)
  - created_at
  - updated_at

  unique index: [user_id, organization_id]
```

### organizations_invitations

```sql
organizations_invitations
  - id (primary key)
  - organization_id (foreign key, indexed)
  - email (string, required, indexed)
  - role (string, default: 'member')
  - token (string, unique, indexed)
  - invited_by_id (foreign key, nullable)
  - accepted_at (datetime, nullable)
  - expires_at (datetime)
  - created_at
  - updated_at

  unique index: [organization_id, email] where accepted_at is null
```

## Ownership rules

- Every organization has exactly one owner
- Owner cannot leave the organization (must transfer ownership first)
- Ownership can be transferred to any admin: `org.transfer_ownership_to!(other_admin)`
- When ownership is transferred, old owner becomes admin

## Edge cases handled

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| User removed from current org | Auto-switches to next available org |
| User has no organizations | Redirects to configurable path (or allowed if `always_require_users_to_belong_to_one_organization: false`) |
| User signs up, no org yet | `current_organization` returns `nil`, `belongs_to_any_organization?` returns `false` |
| Last owner tries to leave | Raises `CannotLeaveAsLastOwner`, must transfer ownership first |
| Two admins leave simultaneously | Row-level lock prevents both from leaving if one would be last |
| Invitation accepted twice (race condition) | Row-level lock, second request returns existing membership |
| Two admins invite same email | Unique constraint, second returns existing invitation |
| Invitation for existing member | Returns error, doesn't duplicate |
| Expired invitation resent | New token generated, expiry reset |
| Ownership transfer to removed user | Transaction lock, verifies membership exists before transfer |
| Concurrent role changes on same user | Row-level lock on membership row |
| Session points to org user was removed from | `current_organization` verifies membership, clears stale session |
| Token collision on invitation | Unique constraint, regenerates token |

## Performance notes

The gem is designed to avoid N+1 queries when used correctly. Here's what you need to know.

### Eager loading for listings

When iterating over memberships or invitations, use `includes` to avoid N+1:

```ruby
# Listing members — GOOD
org.memberships.includes(:user).each do |membership|
  membership.user.name  # No N+1
end

# Listing members — BAD (N+1 on user)
org.memberships.each do |membership|
  membership.user.name  # Queries DB for each user
end

# Listing invitations — GOOD
org.invitations.includes(:invited_by).each do |invitation|
  invitation.invited_by.name  # No N+1
end
```

### Permission checks are in-memory

Permission checks **never hit the database**. They read the role from the already-loaded membership and check against a pre-computed permission hash:

```ruby
# This does NOT query the DB
user.has_organization_permission_to?(:invite_members)

# Safe to call in loops
org.memberships.includes(:user).each do |m|
  m.has_permission_to?(:invite_members)  # No DB query, just hash lookup
end
```

### Role checks with explicit org

When checking roles against a specific organization, the gem is smart about reusing loaded data:

```ruby
# If memberships are already loaded, this won't query again
user.organizations.includes(:memberships).each do |org|
  user.is_admin_of?(org)  # Reuses loaded membership
end

# But if you call it in isolation, it queries the DB
user.is_admin_of?(some_org)  # Single query to find membership
```

### Organization switcher optimization

The `organization_switcher_data` helper is optimized for navbar use:

```ruby
# Internally, it:
# 1. Selects only id, name (not full objects)
# 2. Memoizes within the request
# 3. Returns a lightweight hash, not ActiveRecord objects

organization_switcher_data
# => { current: { id: "...", name: "Acme" }, others: [...] }
```

### Counter caches for member counts

If you display member counts frequently (pricing pages, org listings), consider adding a counter cache:

```ruby
# In a migration
add_column :organizations_organizations, :memberships_count, :integer, default: 0, null: false

# Reset existing counts
Organization.find_each do |org|
  Organization.reset_counters(org.id, :memberships)
end
```

The gem automatically uses the counter cache if present:

```ruby
org.member_count
# Uses memberships_count column if it exists
# Falls back to COUNT(*) query otherwise
```

### Existence checks use SQL

Boolean checks use efficient SQL `EXISTS` queries:

```ruby
user.belongs_to_any_organization?     # SELECT 1 FROM organizations_memberships WHERE ... LIMIT 1
user.has_pending_organization_invitations?  # SELECT 1 FROM organizations_invitations WHERE ... LIMIT 1
org.has_any_members?                  # SELECT 1 FROM organizations_memberships WHERE ... LIMIT 1
```

### Scoped associations use JOINs

Methods like `org.admins` and `user.owned_organizations` use proper SQL JOINs:

```ruby
org.admins
# SELECT users.* FROM users
# INNER JOIN organizations_memberships ON organizations_memberships.user_id = users.id
# WHERE organizations_memberships.organization_id = ? AND organizations_memberships.role IN ('admin', 'owner')

user.owned_organizations
# SELECT organizations_organizations.* FROM organizations_organizations
# INNER JOIN organizations_memberships ON organizations_memberships.organization_id = organizations_organizations.id
# WHERE organizations_memberships.user_id = ? AND organizations_memberships.role = 'owner'
```

### Current organization memoization

`current_organization` is memoized within each request:

```ruby
# In your controller, these all return the same cached object
current_organization  # Queries DB (first call)
current_organization  # Returns cached (subsequent calls)
current_organization  # Returns cached
```

### Bulk operations

For bulk invitations (coming in roadmap), the gem will support skipping per-record callbacks:

```ruby
# Future API
org.bulk_invite!(emails, skip_callbacks: true)
# Fires on_bulk_invited once instead of on_member_invited N times
```

## Data integrity

The gem handles concurrent access and race conditions to ensure data consistency.

### Unique constraints

These constraints prevent duplicate data at the database level:

| Constraint | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `memberships [user_id, organization_id]` | User can only have one membership per org |
| `invitations [organization_id, email] WHERE accepted_at IS NULL` | Only one pending invitation per email per org |
| `invitations [token]` | Invitation tokens are globally unique |

### Row-level locking

The gem uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` (row-level locks) to prevent race conditions:

**Invitation acceptance:**
```ruby
# Two users clicking "Accept" on same invitation simultaneously
invitation.accept!

# Internally:
# 1. Lock invitation row
# 2. Check accepted_at is nil
# 3. Create membership
# 4. Set accepted_at
# 5. Release lock
# Second request sees accepted_at is set, returns existing membership
```

**Ownership transfer:**
```ruby
org.transfer_ownership_to!(new_owner)

# Internally:
# 1. Lock organization row
# 2. Lock old owner's membership
# 3. Lock new owner's membership
# 4. Verify new owner is a member
# 5. Demote old owner to admin
# 6. Promote new owner to owner
# 7. Release locks
```

**Last admin/owner protection:**
```ruby
user.leave_organization!(org)

# Internally:
# 1. Lock organization row
# 2. Count remaining owners/admins
# 3. If last owner, raise CannotLeaveAsLastOwner
# 4. If allowed, destroy membership
# 5. Release lock
```

**Role changes:**
```ruby
membership.promote_to!(:admin)

# Internally:
# 1. Lock membership row
# 2. Update role
# 3. Release lock
```

### Transaction boundaries

Multi-step operations are wrapped in transactions:

```ruby
# Organization creation (atomic)
user.create_organization!("Acme")
# Transaction: create org → create owner membership → set as current org

# Invitation acceptance (atomic)
invitation.accept!
# Transaction: lock invitation → create membership → update accepted_at

# Ownership transfer (atomic)
org.transfer_ownership_to!(user)
# Transaction: lock rows → demote old owner → promote new owner
```

### Graceful handling of constraint violations

When unique constraints are violated, the gem handles it gracefully:

```ruby
# Inviting an already-invited email
current_user.send_organization_invite_to!("already@invited.com")
# => Returns existing pending invitation (doesn't raise)

# Accepting an already-accepted invitation
invitation.accept!
# => Returns existing membership (doesn't raise)

# Adding an existing member
org.add_member!(existing_user)
# => Returns existing membership (doesn't raise)
```

### Session integrity

When a user is removed from their current organization:

```ruby
# User's session points to org_id = 123
# Admin removes user from org 123

# On user's next request:
current_organization
# 1. Finds org 123
# 2. Verifies user has membership in org 123
# 3. Membership doesn't exist → clears session, returns nil
# 4. require_organization! redirects to on_no_organization handler
```

This prevents users from accessing organizations they've been removed from, even if their session still references that org.

### Database indexes

The gem creates these indexes automatically:

```sql
-- Fast membership lookups
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_organizations_memberships_on_user_and_org ON organizations_memberships (user_id, organization_id);
CREATE INDEX index_organizations_memberships_on_organization_id ON organizations_memberships (organization_id);
CREATE INDEX index_organizations_memberships_on_role ON organizations_memberships (role);

-- Fast invitation lookups
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_organizations_invitations_on_token ON organizations_invitations (token);
CREATE INDEX index_organizations_invitations_on_email ON organizations_invitations (email);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_organizations_invitations_pending ON organizations_invitations (organization_id, LOWER(email)) WHERE accepted_at IS NULL;
```

## Migration from 1:1 relationships

If your app currently has `User belongs_to :organization` (1:1), migrate to `User has_many :organizations, through: :memberships` by backfilling memberships and removing direct `organization_id` dependencies incrementally.
